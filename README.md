# Worklog4Slac
A WIP slack bot to help count and manage hours for your remote employees through a chat channel
## How to use
The bot is in a useable state at this point in time. You still will need to build it.
You will need a dedicated place to run the program on. Once you have compiled the program, make a new text file named  `slack.token`
You can put your API token in there in one line for the program to use. 
Then, add the bot to the right channel andsay hello. You will get a help screen to help you get started. 
Disclaimer: Some commands will likely not work such as leaderboards.
